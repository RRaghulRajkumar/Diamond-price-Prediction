## End to End Machine Learning Project
# Diamond Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth percentage. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a model that can provide accurate predictions, allowing users to estimate diamond prices with confidence.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [dataset source]. It includes information on diamond characteristics such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth percentage, table percentage, and price.

## Features

- **Carat Weight:** The weight of the diamond in carats.
- **Cut:** The quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color:** The color grade of the diamond (from J to D, with J being the lowest and D being the highest).
- **Clarity:** The clarity grade of the diamond (from I1 to IF, with I1 being the lowest and IF being the highest).
- **Depth Percentage:** The total depth percentage (measured vertically from the culet to the table, divided by the average girdle diameter).
- **Table Percentage:** The width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter.

## Model

We utilized a machine learning model, specifically [insert model type], to predict diamond prices. The model was trained on a labeled dataset, and its performance was evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
